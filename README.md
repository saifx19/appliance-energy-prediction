# Appliance Energy Data Forecasting using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project builds a predictive model for energy-related metrics using machine learning and deep learning. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, regression modeling, and LSTM-based time series forecasting.

## Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleans data by handling missing values, detecting outliers, and scaling features for optimal model performance.

Feature Selection: Employs Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with a Random Forest model to identify the most relevant predictors.

Regression & Forecasting:
Utilizes Linear Regression as a baseline predictive model.
Implements LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for advanced time series forecasting.

Data Visualization: Leverages Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore data patterns and assess model performance.


## Setup Instructions
